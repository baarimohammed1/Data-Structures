# Data-Structures
These Java projects associated with CS112 at Rutgers University demonstrates the implementation and usage of various data structures. Data structures are essential components in computer science and programming, serving as the foundation for organizing and manipulating data efficiently. In these projects, we explore common data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and binary trees.
